# Interplanetary_trajectory_optimization
This is a simple exercise on interplanetary trajectory optimization utilizing lambert solver
There's three main programs in this project:
  1. Assignment_Interplanetary.m: a brute force search method.
  2. Assignment_GA.m: utilizing genetic algorithm optimization.
  3. Assignment_ParticleSwarmOptimization.m: utilizing particle swarm optimization.
Those codes are still pretty messy. Gonna tidy them up once I finished my winter exam.
